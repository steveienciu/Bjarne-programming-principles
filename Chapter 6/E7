/*
Write a granunar for logical expressions. A logical expression is much
like an arithmetic expression except that the operators are ! (not) , -
(complement), & (and), I (or) , and " (exclusive or) . ! and - are prefix
unary operators. A" binds tighter than a I Gust as * binds tighter than +)
so that xly"z means xl(y"z) rather than (xly)"z. The & operator binds
tighter than " so that x"y&z means x"(y&z).
