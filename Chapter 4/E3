/*
Read a sequence of double values into a vector. Think of each value as
the distance between two cities along a given route. Compute and print
the total distance (the sum of all distances). Fmd and print the smallest
and greatest distance between two neighboring cities. Fmd and print the
mean distance between two neighboring cities.
