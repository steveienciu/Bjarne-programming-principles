/*
Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator. Your calculator should be able to handle the five basic math operations - add, subtract, multiply, 
divide, and modulus (remainder) - on two input values.
Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments: two
double values and a character to represent an operation. If the entry arguments are 35.6, 24.1, and '+', the program output should be "The sum
of 35.6 and 24.1 is 59.7.".
