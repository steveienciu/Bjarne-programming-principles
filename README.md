# Principles-and-Paractice-using-Cpp

Trying to learn C++ using "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++" written by Bjarne Stroustrup and thought I'd document it on here to see my progress. I started this in like Novemeber 2021 but made this repository on April 2021. I skipped some questions in the book because I did not feel like doing them or they felt repetitive. Anything marked with an 'F' will be edited and updated later on.
